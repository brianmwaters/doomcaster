This is my attempt at making a raycaster rendering engine completely on my own without libraries to help me.  I'm also not reading on how raycasters work, I'm figuring out how to do things by myself.

A raycaster engine uses rays to tell what it should render on the screen.  Specifically it uses a two dimensional map to make a three dimensional world.  Games like DOOM use raycaster engines.

Here's a working example of a raycaster that I'm using as a model (without reading the code): mdn.github.io/canvas-raycaster/
